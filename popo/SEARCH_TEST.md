# üîç Search Functionality Test

## Current Status: Testing Suggestions

I've added debug logging and test suggestions to help identify the issue.

### What I've Done:

1. **Added Debug Logs**: 
   - Console logs in `generateSuggestions` function
   - Console logs in `useEffect` for search query changes
   - Console logs for display conditions

2. **Added Test Suggestions**:
   - Simple hardcoded suggestions that should always appear
   - Bypassed the complex matching logic temporarily

### How to Test:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. **Go to**: http://localhost:5174
3. **Login to Dashboard**
4. **Click the Search Bar**
5. **Type anything** (even just "a")
6. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Should see: "Search query changed: a"
   - Should see: "Generating suggestions for query: a"
   - Should see: "Test suggestions: [...]"
   - Should see: "Generated suggestions: [...]"

### Expected Behavior:

- **Test suggestions should appear** when typing any character
- **Console should show debug logs** for each step
- **Suggestions should be clickable** and navigate to sections

### If Suggestions Still Don't Appear:

The issue might be:
1. **CSS Display Problem**: Suggestions are generated but not visible
2. **State Update Issue**: React state not updating properly
3. **Component Rendering Issue**: Component not re-rendering

### Next Steps:

1. Check console logs to see if functions are being called
2. If logs appear but no suggestions show ‚Üí CSS issue
3. If no logs appear ‚Üí JavaScript/React issue
4. If suggestions show but don't work ‚Üí Event handler issue

Let me know what you see in the console!
